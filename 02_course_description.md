ENGLISH 3345: ELECTRONIC AFRICAN-AMERICAN LITERATURE

This course is designed to familiarize students with various novels, autobiographies, poetry, and short fiction of African American writers from 1760 to the beginning of the 20th century. We will study a number of genres throughout the semester, including poetry, sermons, slave narratives, essays and science fiction. All of the texts for this course will be in electronic form, so students will be required to have a portable electronic eBook reader (such as a Kindle, Nook, Sony reader, etc.).

One of the major goals of the course is to introduce students to a new way of looking at the African American literary tradition by examining how black writers embrace and then further develop earlier traditions within the canon.  The course also looks toward the future of books and writing and how readers of these materials experience these texts in electronic form.
