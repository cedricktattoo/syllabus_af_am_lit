###Goals:

This section of African-American literature is designed to challenge students to engage in a deep study of several classics of African-American literature *while simultaneously* engaging the intersections between technology and culture by participating in online communication and content creation related to the course materials.  There are several overlapping objectives we will attempt to accomplish over the course of the semester:

* Read several classics of African-American literature and illustrate at least a basic understanding of the facts of the texts and their cultural importance through pop quizzes and class discussion
* Write a weekly blog post. Each week students will write a blog post of 500-700 words that focuses on a single theme related to the book or book section assigned for the week  
* Students will complete one __Born Digital__ project which will be presented or distributed to the class through some online means 
* Successfully pass a midterm and final exam

Many of you will be perfectly comfortable with blogging, and a few of you are likely familiar with some of the technical tools such as [HTML](http://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp), [CSS](http://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp), [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax), Adobe Illustrator, and Photoshop that will help you complete the "Born Digital" assignments. For those of you who consider yourselves as "nontechnical," I will give you a very gentle introduction to [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) and some other [open-source software](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source_software) tools, and a platform for collaborating on digital projects called [GitHub](http://techcrunch.com/2012/07/14/what-exactly-is-github-anyway/), all of which will help you develop your technical skills beyond anything you likely thought possible.
