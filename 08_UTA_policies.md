###Attendance:

My attendance policy is generous but also final.  You are allowed *three (3)* absences during the semester.  Once your allotted three absences has been exhausted, I will begin deducting *two (2) points per day* from your *final* grade for the course for every absence after three. This is a function built into my grading software, so points are deducted automatically after you reach your limit.  If you miss a quiz, test, or other graded in-class assignment due to an absence, you will not be able to make up the assignment.

###Drop Policy: 
Students may drop or swap (adding and dropping a class concurrently) classes through self-service in MyMav from the beginning of the registration period through the late registration period. After the late registration period, students must see their academic advisor to drop a class or withdraw. Undeclared students must see an advisor in the University Advising Center. Drops can continue through a point two-thirds of the way through the term or session. It is the student's responsibility to officially withdraw if they do not plan to attend after registering. Students will not be automatically dropped for non-attendance. Repayment of certain types of financial aid administered through the University may be required as the result of dropping classes or withdrawing.
