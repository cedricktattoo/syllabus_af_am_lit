Here is a simple five-point rubric explaining how I rate a blog post. It ranges from 0 (no credit) to 4 (exceptional).

**Rating** 

**Characteristics** 

+ > **4 Points---** *Exceptional.* The blog post entry is focused and coherently integrates examples with explanations or analysis. The entry demonstrates awareness of its own limitations or implications, and it considers multiple perspectives when appropriate. The entry reflects in-depth engagement with the topic. 

+ > **3 Points---** *Satisfactory.* The blog post entry is reasonably focused, and explanations or analysis are mostly based on examples or other evidence. Fewer connections are made between ideas, and though new insights are offered, they are not fully developed. The entry reflects moderate engagement with the topic. 


+ > **2 Points---** *Underdeveloped.* The blog post entry is mostly description or summary, without consideration of alternative perspectives, and few connections are made between ideas. The entry reflects passing engagement with the topic. The blog post may also fail to meet the appropriate length or word count to satisfy the requirements of the assignment.


+ > **1 Point---** *Limited.* The blog post entry is unfocused, or simply rehashes previous comments, and displays no evidence of student engagement with the topic. The blog post may also fail to meet the appropriate length or word count to satisfy the requirements of the assignment.


+  > **No Credit.** The blog post entry is missing or consists of one or two disconnected sentences. 

Please use this rubric as a guide to help you compose your future blog posts.  Also helpful ill be reading blogs written by colleagues in your class, and work on integrating the techniques the best bloggers use to enhance your own.
